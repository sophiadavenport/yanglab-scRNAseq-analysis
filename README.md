# Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline for Fragile X Syndrome Mouse Model

This repository contains code for processing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple mouse samples with different genotypes related to Fragile X Syndrome. The pipeline uses scanpy methods to build and analyze an annotated data object (`AnnData`) from multiple expression matrices and a metadata CSV. The workflow includes quality control, annotation using a hippocampus reference dataset (Yao et al.), and visualization.
